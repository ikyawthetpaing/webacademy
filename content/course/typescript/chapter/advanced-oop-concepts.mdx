Welcome, TypeScript enthusiasts! This chapter dives into the realm of advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in TypeScript. We'll explore abstract classes and methods, mixins, private constructors, and readonly properties, equipping you with tools to design more flexible and robust class structures. Buckle up and get ready to refine your TypeScript OOP skills!

## 1. The Power of Abstraction: Abstract Classes and Methods

Imagine a blueprint for a building foundation that specifies essential elements but leaves room for customization – abstract classes in TypeScript function similarly:

**Abstract Classes:**

- Abstract classes define a blueprint for a class that cannot be instantiated directly.
- They serve as a base class for other classes to inherit from.
- They can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  abstract getArea(): number; // Abstract method (no implementation)

  toString(): string {
    return `Shape (area: ${this.getArea()})`; // Default implementation
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  private width: number;
  private height: number;

  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  private radius: number;

  constructor(radius: number) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  getArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
  }
}

let rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
console.log(rectangle.toString()); // Output: Shape (area: 50)

let circle = new Circle(3);
console.log(circle.toString()); // Output: Shape (area: 28.279999999999997) (assuming Math.PI is used)
```

**Remember:**

- Abstract classes enforce a contract by defining required methods that derived classes must implement.
- This promotes code consistency and ensures that derived classes provide the necessary functionality.

## 2. Unveiling the Mixin Magic: Mixins in TypeScript

Imagine building blocks for adding functionalities to different classes – mixins in TypeScript offer similar functionality:

**Mixins:**

- Mixins are utility classes that contain reusable functionalities.
- They cannot be instantiated directly but can be mixed into other classes using interfaces.

```typescript
interface Loggable {
  log(message: string): void;
}

class Logger implements Loggable {
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${message}`);
  }
}

class Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;

  constructor(name: string, price: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }
}

class ProductService extends Product implements Loggable {
  constructor(name: string, price: number) {
    super(name, price);
  }

  logProductInfo(): void {
    this.log(`Product: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`); // Using the mixed-in 'log' method
  }
}

const mixinLogger = new Logger(); // Mixin cannot be instantiated directly
const productService = new ProductService("T-Shirt", 20);
productService.logProductInfo(); // Output: [Current Date and Time] Product: T-Shirt, Price: 20
```

**Remember:**

- Mixins promote code reusability by encapsulating common functionalities that can be shared across various classes.
- Interfaces are used to define the contract (e.g., `Loggable`) that mixins must implement.

## 3. Unveiling the Mystery: Using Private Constructors and Readonly Properties

Imagine a building with a restricted entrance and unchangeable foundation – private constructors and readonly properties in TypeScript offer similar functionality:

**Private Constructors:**

- Private constructors prevent a class from being instantiated directly outside of its containing class.
- This can be useful for singletons or factory patterns.

```typescript
class Database {
  private static instance: Database; // Private static property to hold the singleton instance

  private constructor() {} // Private constructor

  public static getInstance(): Database {
    if (!Database.instance) {
      Database.instance = new Database();
    }
    return Database.instance;
  }

  // Database connection logic
}

// Attempting to directly create an instance will cause a compilation error

let database = Database.getInstance(); // Singleton access
```

**Remember:**

- Private constructors enforce controlled instantiation, often used for singletons or factory patterns.

**Readonly Properties:**

- Readonly properties are properties that can only be assigned a value during initialization or within the constructor.
- They cannot be modified after that.

```typescript
class User {
  readonly id: number;
  name: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Attempting to modify 'id' after initialization will cause a compilation error
  // this.id = 100;
}

let user = new User(123, "Alice");
console.log(user.id); // Output: 123 (read-only value)
```

**Remember:**

- Readonly properties protect data integrity by preventing accidental modifications after initialization.

## 4. Code Example: Utilizing Advanced OOP Concepts (Authentication Service)

Let's build a simple authentication service example that incorporates advanced OOP concepts:

```typescript
abstract class AuthenticationService {
  abstract login(username: string, password: string): boolean;

  abstract getUserInfo(): User | null; // May return null if not logged in
}

class DatabaseAuthService extends AuthenticationService {
  private users: { [key: string]: User } = {}; // User store (simulated)

  constructor() {
    this.users = {
      admin: { id: 1, name: "Administrator", permissions: ["read", "write"] },
      user: { id: 2, name: "John Doe" },
    };
  }

  login(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    const user = this.users[username];
    if (user && user.password === password) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  getUserInfo(): User | null {
    // Logic to retrieve logged-in user information from database (simulated)
    return { id: 1, name: "Administrator", permissions: ["read", "write"] }; // Assuming successful login
  }
}

class AuthService implements Loggable {
  // Mixing in the Loggable functionality
  private static instance: AuthService;
  private authService: AuthenticationService;

  private constructor(authService: AuthenticationService) {
    this.authService = authService;
  }

  public static getInstance(authService: AuthenticationService): AuthService {
    if (!AuthService.instance) {
      AuthService.instance = new AuthService(authService);
    }
    return AuthService.instance;
  }

  login(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    const success = this.authService.login(username, password);
    if (success) {
      this.log(`User ${username} logged in successfully.`);
    } else {
      this.log(`Login failed for user ${username}.`);
    }
    return success;
  }

  getUserInfo(): User | null {
    return this.authService.getUserInfo();
  }

  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${message}`);
  }
}

const databaseAuthService = new DatabaseAuthService();
const authService = AuthService.getInstance(databaseAuthService);

const loggedIn = authService.login("admin", "secret");
if (loggedIn) {
  const userInfo = authService.getUserInfo();
  console.log(`Welcome, ${userInfo?.name}! (ID: ${userInfo?.id})`); // Using optional chaining for safety
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define an abstract `AuthenticationService` class with abstract methods for login and user information retrieval.
2. We implement a concrete `DatabaseAuthService` that extends the abstract class and provides specific logic for user authentication based on a simulated user store.
3. We create an `AuthService` class as a singleton using private constructors and mix in the `Loggable` interface for logging functionalities.
4. This example demonstrates the combined use of abstract classes, mixins, private constructors, and readonly properties for a more robust and maintainable authentication service implementation.

**Remember:**

- Advanced OOP concepts in TypeScript empower you to design flexible, reusable, and secure class structures for your applications.
