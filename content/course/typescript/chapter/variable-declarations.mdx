title: "TypeScript Variable Declarations"
---

Welcome, aspiring TypeScript developers! This chapter delves into the world of variable declarations, the cornerstone of storing and managing data within your code. We'll explore the power of `let` and `const` keywords, delve into the concept of variable scoping, and equip you with the knowledge to effectively annotate variables with types for enhanced code clarity and maintainability.

## 1. The Mighty Duo: `let` and `const`

Imagine a carpenter building a magnificent structure – they wouldn't use random tools, right? Similarly, TypeScript offers two primary keywords for declaring variables: `let` and `const`. Let's explore their unique functionalities:

**a) `let` Keyword:**

- Used to declare variables whose values can be reassigned later in your code.
- Ideal for situations where the variable's value needs to change during program execution.

```typescript
let age: number = 30; // Declares a variable 'age' of type 'number' and assigns the initial value 30
age = 35; // Reassigning a new value to 'age' is allowed
console.log(age); // Output: 35
```

**b) `const` Keyword:**

- Used to declare variables with constant values that cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- Enhances code clarity and prevents accidental modifications.

```typescript
const PI: number = 3.14159; // Declares a constant 'PI' of type 'number' with the value 3.14159
// PI = 3.16; // This line will cause a compilation error because 'const' variables cannot be reassigned
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14159
```

**Remember:**

- Choosing the appropriate keyword (`let` or `const`) depends on whether the variable's value needs to change throughout your code.
- Using `const` by default promotes immutability and reduces the risk of unintended modifications.

## 2. Scoping Secrets: Where Variables Live

Imagine a bustling city with designated districts – variables in TypeScript also have their own designated areas of existence called scopes. Scoping determines the accessibility of variables within different parts of your code.

**a) Block Scope (Introduced with `let` and `const`):**

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are confined to the block (code enclosed in curly braces {}) they are declared in. This enhances code organization and prevents accidental variable name conflicts.

```typescript
if (true) {
  let message = "Hello from the if block";
  console.log(message); // Output: Hello from the if block
}

// console.log(message); // This line will cause a compilation error because 'message' is not accessible outside the if block
```

**b) Global Scope (Using `var`, not recommended in TypeScript):**

While not recommended in modern TypeScript development, variables declared with the `var` keyword (inherited from JavaScript) have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in your code, which can lead to naming conflicts and unexpected behavior.

```typescript
// Not recommended! Use 'let' or 'const' for variable declarations.
var globalVar = "This is a global variable";

function greet() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Global variables can be accessed from functions
}

greet(); // Output: This is a global variable
```

**Remember:**

- Block scope promotes code clarity and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.
- While `var` exists for historical reasons, it's generally recommended to use `let` and `const` for variable declarations in TypeScript for better code organization and maintainability.

## 3. The Power of Annotations: Defining Variable Types

As discussed previously, TypeScript empowers you to explicitly define variable types using type annotations. This adds an extra layer of control and makes your code more readable:

```typescript
let age: number = 30; // Declaring 'age' as a variable of type 'number'

let message: string = "Hello, world!"; // Declaring 'message' as a variable of type 'string'

const isLoggedIn: boolean = true; // Declaring 'isLoggedIn' as a constant of type 'boolean'
```

**Remember:**

- Type annotations are optional but highly recommended. They enhance code clarity, improve maintainability, and help catch potential type errors during development.

## 4. Unveiling the Mystery: Type Inference in Action

While type annotations are powerful, TypeScript can often infer the type of a variable based on the value you assign to it. This is known as type inference:

```typescript
let age = 30; // Type inferred as 'number'
let message = "Hello"; // Type inferred as 'string'
let isActive = true; // Type inferred as 'boolean'
```

**Remember:**

- Type inference is a convenient feature, but it's not foolproof. Explicitly defining types using annotations can improve code clarity and maintainability, especially in complex scenarios.

## 5. Code Example: Utilizing Variable Declarations (Shopping Cart System)

Let's build a simple shopping cart system example to illustrate variable declarations and type annotations in action:

```typescript
let product: string = "T-Shirt"; // Declares a variable 'product' of type 'string' with initial value 'T-Shirt'
let quantity: number = 2; // Declares a variable 'quantity' of type 'number' with initial value 2
const price: number = 19.99; // Declares a constant 'price' of type 'number' with initial value 19.99 (cannot be reassigned)

function calculateTotalPrice(
  product: string,
  quantity: number,
  price: number
): number {
  return quantity * price;
}

let totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(product, quantity, price);
console.log(
  "Total price for " + quantity + " " + product + "s: $" + totalPrice.toFixed(2)
); // Output: Total price for 2 T-Shirts: $39.98
```

**Explanation:**

1. We declare variables with appropriate types (`product`, `quantity`) and a constant (`price`) for the shopping cart scenario.
2. The `calculateTotalPrice` function takes typed parameters (`product`, `quantity`, `price`) and returns the total price.
3. We call the function with the declared variables, demonstrating how type annotations enhance code readability and maintainability.

**Remember:**

- Combining variable declarations with type annotations empowers you to write clear, concise, and type-safe code in TypeScript.

## Conclusion: Mastering the Art of Storage

By understanding `let`, `const`, variable scoping, and type annotations for variables, you've equipped yourself with the fundamental tools for managing data effectively in your TypeScript projects. This empowers you to write more organized, predictable, and maintainable code. As you progress, explore advanced topics like destructuring and variable hoisting (which applies to `var` but not `let`/`const`) to further refine your variable handling skills in TypeScript.

**Remember:**

- Variable declarations are the building blocks of any programming language. Mastering them in TypeScript unlocks the potential for robust and well-structured code.
