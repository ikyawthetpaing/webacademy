Welcome, TypeScript enthusiasts! In this chapter, we'll embark on a journey to explore the depths of the TypeScript type system. We'll delve into conditional types, mapped types, and type inference/deduction, features that empower you to write more expressive, flexible, and type-safe code. Buckle up and get ready to unlock the true potential of TypeScript's typing capabilities!

## 1. Mastering Conditions with Conditional Types

Imagine writing types that change their behavior based on conditions – that's the magic of conditional types in TypeScript! They allow you to define the structure of a type based on the outcome of a type check.

**Syntax:**

```typescript
type ConditionalType<T extends X | Y, Y extends Z | never = never> = T extends X
  ? TypeIfTrue
  : TypeIfFalse;
```

- `T extends X | Y`: Checks if the type `T` extends either `X` or `Y`.
- `Y extends Z | never`: (Optional) An additional check on the type `Y`.
- `TypeIfTrue`: The type to use if the condition `T extends X` is true.
- `TypeIfFalse`: The type to use if the condition `T extends X` is false.

**Example 1: String Literal Type Check**

Let's define a type that represents either a "success" or "error" string literal:

```typescript
type Message<T extends string> = T extends "success" ? string : never;

const successMessage: Message<"success"> = "Operation successful!"; // Type safe
// const errorMessage: Message<"error"> = "An error occurred"; // Error: Type 'error' does not extend 'success'
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a generic type `Message` that takes a string literal type `T` as a parameter.
2. Inside the conditional type, we check if `T` extends "success".
3. If the condition is true, the type becomes `string`, allowing us to assign a string value to the `successMessage` variable.
4. If the condition is false (any other string literal besides "success"), the type becomes `never`, preventing assignment of any value to a variable of type `Message`.

**Example 2: Function Argument Type Check**

Imagine a function that expects either a number or a string argument and returns a different type based on the argument type:

```typescript
type Length<T> = ConditionalType<T, string, number>;

function getLength<T>(arg: T): Length<T> {
  return (arg as string).length; // Safe type assertion for clarity
}

const numLength = getLength(10); // Type: number (length of number 10)
const strLength = getLength("Hello"); // Type: number (length of string "Hello")
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a generic type `Length` that uses a conditional type to infer the return type based on the argument type.
2. The conditional type checks if `T` extends `string`.
3. If `T` is a string, the return type becomes `number` (length of the string).
4. If `T` is not a string (i.e., a number), the return type remains `T` (unchanged).
5. The `getLength` function takes a generic argument `T` and uses a type assertion to ensure the argument is treated as a string for length calculation.

**Remember:**

- Conditional types provide flexibility in defining types based on runtime conditions.
- Use them to create type guards that ensure type safety and prevent invalid assignments.

## 2. Reshaping Types with Mapped Types

Imagine creating a new type by transforming the properties of an existing type – that's the power of mapped types in TypeScript! They allow you to iterate over the properties of a type and create a new type with modified properties.

**Syntax:**

```typescript
type MappedType<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: /* Transformation applied to each property of type T */;
};
```

- `T`: The type whose properties you want to iterate over.
- `P in keyof T`: Looping through each property key (`P`) of the type `T`.
- `/* Transformation applied to each property of type T */`: The transformation you want to apply to each property (e.g., changing type, adding a prefix).

**Example 1: Making Properties Optional**

Let's create a new type that makes all properties of an existing type optional:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
};

type OptionalUser = MappedType<User>; // This won't work yet!

// Fix: Use a conditional type within the mapped type
type OptionalUser = MappedType<User> = {
  [P in keyof User]?: User[P];
};

const maybeUser: OptionalUser = {
  name: "John", // Optional property
};

// const invalidUser: OptionalUser = {}; // Error: All properties are optional now
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a type `User` with three properties.
2. We attempt to define `OptionalUser` as a mapped type of `User`. However, this results in an error because mapped types require a transformation for each property.
3. We fix the error by using a conditional type within the mapped type definition.
4. Inside the mapped type, we iterate over each property key (`P`) of `User`.
5. The conditional type `User[P] ?` makes each property type optional by using the question mark (`?`).
6. The `maybeUser` variable demonstrates assigning a partial user object with only the `name` property.

**Example 2: Adding a Prefix to Property Names**

Let's create a new type that adds a "user\_" prefix to all property names of an existing type:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type UserWithPrefix = MappedType<User> = {
  [`user_${P}`]: User[P];
};

const prefixedUser: UserWithPrefix = {
  user_name: "Alice",
  user_age: 30,
};
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a type `User` with two properties.
2. We define `UserWithPrefix` as a mapped type of `User`.
3. Inside the mapped type, we use template literals (`user*${P}`) to create new property names with the "user\*" prefix before each original property key (`P`).
4. The type of each property remains the same as in the original `User` type.
5. The `prefixedUser` variable demonstrates assigning values to the prefixed properties.

**Remember:**

- Mapped types offer a powerful way to transform existing types into new types with modified properties.
- Use them to create optional properties, add prefixes/suffixes, or apply other transformations.

## 3. Unveiling the Magic: Type Inference and Deduction

Throughout your TypeScript journey, you've likely encountered type inference and deduction – these concepts are fundamental to how TypeScript automatically determines the types of variables and expressions.

**Type Inference:**

- The process by which TypeScript automatically assigns a type to a variable or expression based on its initialization value or usage context.
- Reduces the need for explicit type annotations, improving code readability.

**Example:**

```typescript
const message = "Hello, world!"; // Type inferred as string
const sum = 10 + 20; // Type inferred as number

function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const greeting = greet("Alice"); // Type of 'greeting' inferred as string
```

**Type Deduction:**

- A more complex process where TypeScript infers the type of a variable based on its usage within a broader context, such as function arguments or conditional statements.

**Example:**

```typescript
let value: number | string;

if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
  value = "String value";
} else {
  value = 10;
}

// Type of 'value' is inferred as 'string | number' based on its possible values
console.log(value);
```

**Remember:**

- While type inference and deduction are powerful, it's recommended to use explicit type annotations in certain scenarios for clarity and maintainability.
- For complex scenarios, consider using type assertions to provide the compiler with additional information about the types involved.
