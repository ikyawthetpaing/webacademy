TypeScript's ability to add static typing to JavaScript unlocks a new level of power and safety for your development. This chapter dives into integrating TypeScript with popular frameworks and libraries, empowering you to build robust and maintainable applications. We'll explore:

- **React with TypeScript:** Streamline component development and enhance type safety.
- **Node.js with TypeScript:** Build type-safe backend applications and APIs.
- **Typing Third-Party Libraries:** Tame the wild world of JavaScript libraries with TypeScript.

## React with TypeScript

React, the dominant player in UI development, embraces TypeScript beautifully. Let's see how:

**1. Setting Up a TypeScript React Project:**

- **Create a React project with TypeScript:** Use `create-react-app` with the `--template typescript` flag:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app --template typescript
```

- **Project Structure:** You'll have a standard React project structure with TypeScript-enabled components (`.tsx` extension).

**2. Creating a Typed React Component:**

```typescript
// MyButton.tsx

interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick?: () => void; // Optional click handler
}

const MyButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
  );
};

export default MyButton;
```

**Explanation:**

- We define an interface `ButtonProps` to specify the expected properties of our component. This ensures type safety when using the component elsewhere.
- The `React.FC<ButtonProps>` generic type ensures the component function expects `ButtonProps` as its props.
- We use type annotations for props like `label` and `onClick`.

**3. Using the Typed Component:**

```typescript
// App.tsx

import MyButton from './MyButton';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <MyButton label="Click Me!" onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- We import the `MyButton` component with its type information.
- The compiler ensures we pass the correct types to the component's props (e.g., `onClick` requires a function).

**Benefits:**

- **Improved Code Clarity:** Interfaces and types make your component behavior more explicit.
- **Early Error Detection:** The compiler catches potential type mismatches during development.
- **Enhanced Refactoring:** Type safety guides you through code changes and refactorings.

## Node.js with TypeScript

Node.js, the king of server-side JavaScript, works seamlessly with TypeScript. Let's build a simple API:

**1. Setting Up a Node.js Project with TypeScript:**

- **Initialize a TypeScript project:**

```bash
tsc --init
```

- Install required packages like `express` and `typescript`:

```bash
npm install express typescript
```

**2. Creating a TypeScript Node.js Server:**

```typescript
// server.ts

import express, { Request, Response } from "express";

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("Hello from TypeScript!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `express` and type information for `Request` and `Response` objects.
- Type annotations ensure we handle request and response objects correctly.

**3. Compiling and Running the Server:**

```bash
tsc && node server.js
```

- Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using `tsc`.
- Run the compiled JavaScript file using `node server.js`.

**Benefits:**

- **Type-Safe API Endpoints:** Enforce expected data types for request data and responses.
- **Reduced Server-Side Errors:** Catch potential type issues during development.
- **Maintainable Server Code:** Types improve code clarity and maintainability.

## Typing Third-Party Libraries

The vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries can be a double-edged sword. TypeScript helps us tame them:

**1. Utilizing Type Definitions:**

Many popular libraries provide official type definition files (`.d.ts`) that describe their types and functions. These files can be installed through npm packages:

```bash
npm install @types/lodash
```

**2. Leveraging Type Annotations:**

Once installed, you can use type annotations to leverage the provided type definitions:

```typescript
// Using Lodash with TypeScript

import _ from "lodash";

const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubledNumbers: number[] = _.map(numbers, (num: number) => num * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `lodash` and utilize the type information (often implicitly available through type definitions).
- We define `numbers` as an array of `number`s.
- The `_.map` function expects an array and a callback function with a `number` argument.
- The compiler ensures type safety throughout the code.

**3. Handling Libraries Without Type Definitions:**

For libraries lacking official type definitions, you have options:

- **Write Custom Type Definitions:** Create a `.d.ts` file to describe the library's types.
- **Use JSDoc Comments:** Libraries sometimes use JSDoc comments to describe their types. TypeScript can sometimes infer types from these comments.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved Code Quality:** Type annotations make code more readable and maintainable.
- **Reduced Runtime Errors:** Catch potential type mismatches before runtime.
- **Enhanced Refactoring:** Types guide you through code changes and library upgrades.

**Advanced Considerations**

- **Generic Types:** Leverage generic types in libraries like React or utility libraries for broader type safety.
- **Advanced Type Features:** Explore more advanced features like mapped types, conditional types, and utility types for complex type manipulations.

## Bonus: Example with Express and Mongoose

Here's a glimpse of using TypeScript with Express and Mongoose for a simple API with a type-safe model:

```typescript
// user.model.ts

interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

export default mongoose.model<User>(
  "User",
  new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
  })
);
```

```typescript
// server.ts (partial example)

import User, { User } from './user.model';

app.get('/users', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const users: User[] = await User.find();
    res.json(users);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Server Error');
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

By integrating TypeScript with frameworks, libraries, and your own code, you unlock a powerful combination of static typing and JavaScript's flexibility. This approach leads to:

- **Reduced Development Time:** Catching errors early and preventing runtime issues saves debugging time.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Type-safe code is easier to understand and modify over time.
- **Increased Confidence:** Knowing your code is type-safe gives you peace of mind and allows for more robust development.

Embrace TypeScript's power to elevate your JavaScript projects to new levels of safety and efficiency!
