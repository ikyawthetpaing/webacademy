title: "JavaScript Control Flow"
---

Control flow dictates the order in which statements are executed within your JavaScript program. In this chapter, we'll delve into the essential control flow constructs: conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`), the `switch` statement, and various looping mechanisms (`for`, `while`, and `do-while`). These tools allow you to make decisions, repeat code blocks, and create dynamic program behavior.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements enable your program to make decisions based on specific conditions.

**1. `if` Statement:**

The `if` statement executes a code block only if the specified condition evaluates to true.

```javascript
let age = 25;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

**2. `else if` Statement:**

The `else if` statement provides additional conditional checks after an initial `if` statement doesn't evaluate to true. You can chain multiple `else if` statements.

```javascript
let grade = 85;

if (grade >= 90) {
  console.log("Excellent!");
} else if (grade >= 80) {
  console.log("Very good!");
} else if (grade >= 70) {
  console.log("Good.");
} else {
  console.log("Needs improvement.");
}
```

**3. `else` Statement:**

The `else` statement is an optional block that executes if none of the preceding conditions in `if` or `else if` statements are met.

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = false;

if (isLoggedIn) {
  console.log("Welcome back!");
} else {
  console.log("Please log in.");
}
```

## Switch Statement

The `switch` statement provides a multi-way branching mechanism based on the value of an expression. It can be a more concise alternative to multiple `if` statements for handling several distinct cases.

```javascript
let day = "Tuesday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
  case "Tuesday":
  case "Wednesday":
  case "Thursday":
  case "Friday":
    console.log("It's a weekday.");
    break; // Exit the switch statement after matching a case
  case "Saturday":
  case "Sunday":
    console.log("It's a weekend.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day of the week."); // Default case for non-matching values
}
```

## Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

**1. `for` Loop:**

The `for` loop iterates a specific number of times based on a counter variable.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration:", i);
}
```

**2. `while` Loop:**

The `while` loop continues executing a code block as long as a specified condition remains true.

```javascript
let count = 0;

while (count < 3) {
  console.log("Count:", count);
  count++; // Update the counter to eventually exit the loop
}
```

**3. `do-while` Loop:**

The `do-while` loop guarantees at least one execution of the code block before checking the condition.

```javascript
let input = "";

do {
  input = prompt("Enter your name (or 'quit' to exit):");
  if (input !== "quit") {
    console.log("Hello,", input);
  }
} while (input !== "quit");
```

**Key Points:**

- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to make decisions based on conditions.
- The `switch` statement is useful for handling multiple distinct cases efficiently.
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) allow you to repeat code execution based on specific criteria.
- Choose the appropriate control flow structure based on your program's logic and the desired behavior.

**Practice Exercises:**

1. Write a program that prompts the user for a number and checks if it's even (using the modulo operator).
2. Create a `for` loop that iterates through an array of fruits and prints their names to the console.
3. Implement a `do-while` loop that keeps asking the user for input until they enter a valid password (meeting certain criteria like length).

By mastering control flow concepts, you'll gain the ability to structure your JavaScript code effectively, making
