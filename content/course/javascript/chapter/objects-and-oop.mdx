Objects in JavaScript are fundamental data structures that store key-value pairs. These key-value pairs represent properties (keys) and their corresponding values, providing a flexible way to model real-world entities and their attributes. This chapter delves into object creation, manipulation, core OOP concepts in JavaScript, and ES6 classes.

## Object Creation and Manipulation

**1. Object Literal:**

The most common way to create an object is using the object literal syntax, enclosing key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Software Engineer",
};

console.log(person.firstName); // Output: "John"
console.log(person["age"]); // Accessing a property using bracket notation (useful for dynamic property names)
```

**2. Object Constructor:**

You can define a reusable object constructor function to create multiple objects with similar properties and methods.

```javascript
function User(firstName, lastName, age) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;

  this.getFullName = function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  };
}

let user1 = new User("Alice", "Smith", 25);
let user2 = new User("Bob", "Johnson", 40);

console.log(user1.getFullName()); // Output: "Alice Smith"
console.log(user2.age); // Output: 40
```

**3. Object Methods:**

Methods are functions associated with an object that act upon the object's data. They are defined within the object definition or using the `prototype` property.

**4. Dynamic Addition and Deletion:**

You can dynamically add or remove properties from an object using dot notation or bracket notation, respectively.

```javascript
person.jobTitle = "Developer"; // Adding a property
delete person.occupation; // Removing a property

console.log(person); // Updated object
```

## Prototypes and Prototype Inheritance

**1. Prototypes:**

Every object in JavaScript has a hidden property called `prototype`. This prototype acts as a blueprint for the object, defining the properties and methods that the object inherits.

```javascript
function User(firstName, lastName, age) {
  // ... constructor code
}

console.log(User.prototype); // This will show an empty object initially
```

**2. Prototype Inheritance:**

When you create an object using a constructor function, it inherits properties and methods from its constructor's prototype. This allows for code reuse and avoids redundancy.

```javascript
User.prototype.getFullName = function () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};

let user1 = new User("Alice", "Smith", 25);
console.log(user1.getFullName()); // Output: "Alice Smith" (inherited from prototype)
```

**3. Modifying the Prototype:**

Changes made to the constructor's prototype after object creation will also be reflected in existing objects that inherit from that prototype.

```javascript
User.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.getFullName());
};

user1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice Smith"
```

**4. Creating Your Own Prototypes:**

You can also create your own prototype objects and use them as blueprints for other objects.

```javascript
let personPrototype = {
  getFullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

function Student(firstName, lastName, age, major) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
  this.major = major;
}

Student.prototype = personPrototype; // Setting the prototype for Student

let student1 = new Student("Bob", "Jones", 20, "Computer Science");
console.log(student1.getFullName()); // Output: "Bob Jones" (inherited from personPrototype)
```

## ES6 Classes

**1. Class Syntax:**

ES6 introduced a more traditional class syntax for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }

  getFullName() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

let user1 = new User("Alice", "Smith", 25);
console.log(user1.getFullName()); // Output: "Alice Smith"

// Inheritance using the extends keyword
class Student extends User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, major) {
    super(firstName, lastName, age); // Calling the parent constructor
    this.major = major;
  }

  getMajor() {
    return this.major;
  }
}

let student1 = new Student("Bob", "Jones", 20, "Computer Science");
console.log(student1.getFullName()); // Output: "Bob Jones" (inherited from User)
console.log(student1.getMajor()); // Output: "Computer Science"
```

**2. Class Properties:**

- **Static methods:** These methods are associated with the class itself, not individual instances of the class, and can be called without creating an object.

```javascript
class MathUtils {
  static add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }

  static multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8 (calling static method without creating an object)
```

- **Getters and Setters:** These provide special syntax for accessing and modifying object properties in a controlled way.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // Private property (using convention)
  }

  get fullName() {
    return this._fullName; // Getter method
  }

  set fullName(name) {
    this._fullName = name.toUpperCase(); // Setter method (performs validation or logic before assigning)
  }
}

let person1 = new Person("John", "Doe");
console.log(person1.fullName); // Output: "John Doe"

person1.fullName = "Jane Smith"; // Using the setter
console.log(person1.fullName); // Output: "JANE SMITH"
```

**3. Summary:**

ES6 classes provide a more concise and familiar syntax for object-oriented programming in JavaScript, allowing developers to define classes with properties, methods, inheritance, and various features like static methods and getters/setters.

**Key Points:**

- Objects represent key-value pairs and provide a flexible way to model real-world entities.
- Prototypes act as blueprints for objects, defining inherited properties and methods.
- ES6 classes offer a more structured approach to object creation and inheritance.
- Understanding these concepts is crucial for building well-organized and reusable JavaScript applications.

**Practice Exercises:**

1. Create a `Car` class with properties like `make`, `model`, and `year`, and methods like `accelerate` and `brake`.
2. Implement a `Point` class with properties `x` and `y` and methods to calculate distance from another `Point` object.
3. Design a simple `ShoppingCart` class with methods to add items, remove items, and calculate the total price.

By practicing and experimenting with object-oriented concepts, you'll gain the skills to create more complex and maintainable JavaScript programs.
