title: "React Server-side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)"
---

In today's web landscape, delivering a fast and engaging user experience is crucial. This chapter delves into Server-side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), two powerful rendering techniques in Next.js, exploring their functionalities, implementation, and benefits for React applications.

## 1. Understanding SSR and SSG:

**1.1. Server-side Rendering (SSR):**

- **Concept:** With SSR, the server renders the entire HTML content, including dynamic data, on each request. This process involves:
  - The server receives a request from the client (browser).
  - The server fetches any necessary data (e.g., from an API).
  - The server uses the data to render the React components as HTML.
  - The fully rendered HTML is sent to the client (browser).

**1.2. Static Site Generation (SSG):**

- **Concept:** With SSG, the HTML content is pre-rendered at build time, including any necessary data. This process involves:
  - The developer defines which pages need to be pre-rendered.
  - During the build process, Next.js pre-renders the pages using the provided data.
  - The pre-rendered HTML files are served to the client (browser).

**2. Choosing the Right Technique:**

- **SSR:** Ideal for applications requiring real-time data updates, personalized user experiences, or complex interactions.
- **SSG:** Best suited for content-heavy websites, SEO-focused pages, or situations where real-time data updates are not essential.

## 2. Setting up SSR with Next.js:

**1. Creating a Next.js Project:**

```bash
npx create-next-app my-ssr-app
```

**2. Utilizing `getStaticProps`:**

- Use `getStaticProps` in your page component to fetch data at build time.
- This function is executed on the server during the build process, allowing you to fetch and process data before rendering the page.

**Example:**

```jsx
// pages/blog/[slug].js

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`);
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      post: data,
    },
  };
}

const BlogPost = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BlogPost;
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `getStaticProps` function is defined within the page component.
2. It receives an object containing page parameters (`params`).
3. We use `fetch` to retrieve data from an API based on the provided slug.
4. The fetched data is returned as props to the page component, making it available for rendering.

**3. Dynamic Routes:**

- Leverage `getStaticPaths` in combination with `getStaticProps` to pre-render pages for specific routes.

```jsx
// pages/blog/[slug].js

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
  const posts = await response.json();

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, // Set to 'blocking' or 'true' for dynamic data fetching
  };
}

// ... rest of the code (same as previous example)
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `getStaticPaths` function retrieves a list of post slugs from the API.
2. It iterates through the posts to create an array of `paths` objects, defining the routes for each post.
3. The `fallback` prop determines how to handle unseen slugs (e.g., `false` for 404 errors, `blocking` or `true` for dynamic data fetching).

## 3. Pre-rendering Pages for Improved Performance:

- **Benefits:**
  - Faster initial page load times.
  - Improved SEO as content is readily available to search engines.
  - Reduced server load as pages are pre-rendered.

## 4. SEO Considerations:

- SSR and SSG can both be SEO-friendly, but some aspects require attention:
  - For SSR pages, ensure proper server-side rendering of content and meta tags.
  - For SSG pages, ensure essential content is pre-rendered and available in the initial HTML.
  - Consider using server-side rendering where SEO is crucial and real-time data updates are necessary.
  - Utilize techniques like pre-rendering and sitemaps to improve search engine crawling and indexing.

## 5. Choosing Between SSR and SSG:

- The optimal choice depends on your specific application requirements. Consider factors like:
  - **Content type:** Static content benefits from SSG for faster loading and SEO advantages.
  - **Data updates:** Real-time data updates often favor SSR for dynamic rendering.
  - **User experience:** Complex interactions or personalization might necessitate SSR for a seamless experience.

## 6. Combining SSR and SSG:

- Next.js allows combining SSR and SSG within the same application.
- Use SSR for dynamic pages requiring real-time data updates, while leveraging SSG for static content-heavy pages.

## 7. Example: Combining Techniques:

```jsx
// pages/blog.js (SSG for the blog listing page)

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const posts = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  };
}

const BlogList = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <a href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BlogList;

// pages/blog/[slug].js (SSR for individual blog posts)

export async function getServerSideProps({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`);
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      post: data,
    },
  };
}

const BlogPost = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BlogPost;
```

**Explanation:**

1. `pages/blog.js` uses SSG to pre-render the blog listing page with static data.
2. `pages/blog/[slug].js` utilizes SSR for individual blog posts, allowing for potentially dynamic content and personalization.

## Conclusion:

By understanding SSR, SSG, and their implementation in Next.js, you can enhance your React applications' performance, SEO, and user experience. Carefully choosing the appropriate technique or a combination of both, based on your project's needs, empowers you to deliver an exceptional web experience. Remember, continuously evaluate and optimize your rendering strategies as your application evolves.
